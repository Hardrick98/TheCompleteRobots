Robot Description:

The robot, that now has the arms at its sides, has the following joints with their default angles:
    {
        "Head": 0.0,
        "LeftShoulder": 0.0,
        "LeftArm": 0.0,
        "LeftElbow": 0.0,
        "LeftForearm": 0.0,
        "RightShoulder": 0.0,
        "RightArm": 0.0,
        "RightElbow": 0.0,
        "RightForearm": 0.0
    }

Joint Limits (radians):
{
    "Head": [-2.356, 2.356],
    "LeftShoulder": [-2.356, 2.356],
    "LeftArm": [-2.356, 2.356],
    "LeftElbow": [-2.356, 2.356],
    "LeftForearm": [-2.356, 2.356],
    "RightShoulder": [-2.356, 2.356],
    "RightArm": [-2.356, 2.356],
    "RightElbow": [-2.356, 2.356],
    "RightForearm": [-2.356, 2.356]
}


All axes are defined in a right-handed robot-fixed frame (attached to the torso) where:

    +X = Forward (direction the robot faces).
    +Y = Left.
    +Z = Up.


Joint Rotation Axes:

    Each joint rotates around its specified axis locally (relative to the robot’s frame):
    
       {
            "Head": [0, 0, 1],          # +angle = CCW around Z (nod forward, tilt backward)
            "LeftShoulder": [0, -1, 0],  # +angle = CCW around -Y (forward arm swing)
            "LeftArm": [1, 0, 0],        # +angle = CCW around +X (lifts arm **leftward** sideways)
            "LeftElbow": [0, 0, 1],      # +angle = CCW around Z (bends elbow inward)
            "LeftForearm": [0, -1, 0],   # +angle = CCW around -Y (twists forearm forward)
            "RightShoulder": [0, -1, 0], # +angle = CCW around -Y (mirrors left)
            "RightArm": [-1, 0, 0],      # +angle = CCW around **-X** (lifts arm **rightward** sideways)
            "RightElbow": [0, 0, -1],    # +angle = CCW around -Z (bends elbow inward, mirrors left)
            "RightForearm": [0, -1, 0]   # +angle = CCW around -Y (mirrors left)
       }
    

Note: 
A positive angle always follows the right-hand rule around the given axis. 
That means for an axis like [-1, 0, 0], a positive angle rotates clockwise when looking along -X (as expected). 
You should not flip the angle sign based on axis direction — just follow the axis and right-hand rule.


Task:

    Make the robot perform a T-pose (arms extended horizontally to the sides, forming a "T").
    Specify the joint angles needed, ensuring they respect the limits.

    or

    Task: Make the robot perform a 'hero pose' (hands firmly on your hips, elbows bent at roughly a 90-degree angle). 
    Specify the joint angles needed, ensuring they respect the limits.

    or

    Make the robot perform a military salute (The right upper arm should swing far forward close to face.
    The elbow should bend sharply to bring the hand near the right eyebrow. The hand should face down or slightly inward.) 
    Specify the joint angles needed, ensuring they respect the limits
