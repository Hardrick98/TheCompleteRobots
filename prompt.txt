TASK:
Given this URDF file of a humanoid robot, give me the joint angles to set on the robot in order to assume a <pose> pose. 
The robot default position is arms at its sides.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Give me the list of joint angles in radians
- Embed the joint angles of the pose in a dictionary with the name of the joint as Key and its radians as Value
- The joint name convention must be coherent with the urdf file. 
- Avoid writing comments


pose = ["T-pose","superhero pose", "military salute", "dab pose"]
